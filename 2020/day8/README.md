# --- Day 8: Handheld Halting ---

A bit messy to keep the execution history around.

The second part is just brute force, maybe there's a smarter way? Still, it only takes just above 1.5 ms:
```
running 1 test
test bench_part_2 ... bench:   1,507,469 ns/iter (+/- 82,626)
```

```
% cargo run
   Compiling day8 v0.1.0 (/Users/kwarf/Development/adventofcode/2020/day8)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.62s
     Running `target/debug/day8`
The answer to the first part is: 1584
The answer to the second part is: 920
