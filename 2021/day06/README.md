# --- Day 6: Lanternfish ---

Today's puzzle felt like a Haskell puzzle.
I feel like at least part one ended up very _clean_.

So for part two I ended up with a complete rewrite, part 1 looked
[like this](https://github.com/Kwarf/adventofcode/blob/f5014b1ca7ab2d067013d289ad34d30b20fdb359/2021/day06/main.hs).

```
% time cabal run -v0
The answer to the first part is: 350917
The answer to the second part is: 1592918715629
cabal run -v0  0.04s user 0.02s system 83% cpu 0.069 total
```
