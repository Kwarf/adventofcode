# --- Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---
This was kind of a boring problem in my opinion. I didn't really see the benefit
of using any particular language over another, so I decided to use Rust, since
I've never used it before. That's also why the code isn't that good/pretty.

It expects _one_ argument, a path to the puzzle input, it is provided as
`input.txt` and is passed by the Makefile, just run `make run`. The answer to
both parts of the puzzle will be written to stdout using `printf`.

Requires `rustc` to build.
