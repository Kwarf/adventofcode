# --- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---
This problem was only basic regex matching, so I solved it using Python, since I
haven't used that on any of the earlier problems. I don't write much Python but
I don't think this code turned out too bad.

It expects _one_ argument, a path to the puzzle input, it is provided as
`input.txt`. I've provided a Makefile just so it can be launched as all my other
solutions, by `make run`, or you can run `python main.py input.txt` manually.

Requires `python` to run.
