# --- Day 1: Not Quite Lisp ---
This is the **_first_** program i have **_ever_** written entirely in Assembly,
so there's probably a thousand better ways to do what I'm doing, but it works.

It expects _one_ argument, the puzzle input, it is provided in the Makefile,
just run `make run`. The answer to both parts of the puzzle will be written to
stdout using `printf`.

Requires a 64-bit Linux machine with NASM and GCC to build.
