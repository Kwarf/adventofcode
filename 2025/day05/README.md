# --- Day 5: Cafeteria ---

I thought the puzzles would be way harder by now given that there's only going
to be 12 days.

I will admit that part 2 felt a _bit_ like cheating, just pulling in a library
and changing basically 3 lines of code...

```
% cargo run --release -q
The answer to the first part is: 840
The answer to the second part is: 359913027576322
